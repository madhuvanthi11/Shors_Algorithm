# Shor's Algorithm
Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm developed by Peter Shor in 1994 for finding the prime factors of large numbers much faster than classical computers can. It works by converting the factoring problem into a period-finding problem and solving it efficiently using a quantum Fourier transform. This has major implications for cryptography, as the security of algorithms like RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.
