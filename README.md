# Shor's Algorithm
Shor’s Algorithm is a quantum algorithm developed by Peter Shor in 1994 that efficiently factors large integers, a task that is extremely difficult for classical computers. Its importance lies in the fact that the security of many cryptographic systems, such as RSA, relies on the assumption that factoring large numbers is computationally infeasible. Shor’s algorithm exploits the principles of quantum mechanics—specifically quantum parallelism and the Quantum Fourier Transform—to find the period of a modular exponential function, which can then be used to determine the non-trivial factors of a given number. 

Unlike classical algorithms that require sub-exponential or exponential time to factor large integers, Shor’s algorithm runs in polynomial time, offering an exponential speedup. This breakthrough illustrates the potential power of quantum computation and highlights its profound implications for cryptography and information security in a future where scalable quantum computers exist.
